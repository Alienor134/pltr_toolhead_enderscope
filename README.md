**Originally launched as a [product on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/andrew_sink/pltr-v2-pen-plotter-toolhead/), I've since decided to release it for free!**

The pltr v2 is a 3D printed pen plotter toolhead that is designed to mount on the [Creality Ender 3 Pro](https://amzn.to/37qF5zg) and [Creality Ender 3 V2](https://amzn.to/3s4fB4s) 3D printers. [Installing the pltr is simple](https://youtu.be/c1Wo9KkZKNQ), and only requires three flathead bolts to attach to your printer. 

The [User Guide .PDF](https://github.com/AndrewSink/pltr/blob/main/pltr%20v2%20User%20Guide%20Rev%20C.2.pdf) contains all of the information you should need to get your pltr toolheard printed out and up and running.
