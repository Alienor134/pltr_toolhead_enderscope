**Originally launched as a [product on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/andrew_sink/pltr-v2-pen-plotter-toolhead/), I've since decided to release it for free! If you still want to support this project, you can [buy me a coffee on Ko-Fi!](https://ko-fi.com/andrewsink)**

The pltr v2 is a 3D printed pen plotter toolhead that is designed to mount on the [Creality Ender 3 Pro](https://amzn.to/37qF5zg) and [Creality Ender 3 V2](https://amzn.to/3s4fB4s) 3D printers. [Installing the pltr is simple](https://youtu.be/c1Wo9KkZKNQ), and only requires three flathead bolts to attach to your printer. 

The [User Guide .PDF](https://github.com/AndrewSink/pltr/blob/main/pltr%20v2%20User%20Guide%20Rev%20C.2.pdf) contains all of the information you should need to get starter with your pltr toolhead. Once the pltr toolhead has been installed, you can use the included .gcode files to calibrate your machine.
